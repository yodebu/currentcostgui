# Introduction #
> Note - this is an optional feature, and is not required to use any of the other features of the application.

# Warning #
This feature uploads your historical electricity usage data to a publicly-accessible Google web server, and requires your Google username and password in order to be able to do this.

Every effort will be made to ensure that this data will only be visible in anonymised forms - such as as a part of averages - and not as individual electricity records identified with specific users.

If you have any questions about how the data is used, please do contact dale.lane@gmail.com

If you have any concerns at all, you might want to [review the source for the application](http://code.google.com/p/currentcostgui/source/browse/trunk) to see how your username and password is used. If you still have concerns, ultimately you should not give the application your Google credentials. The application's other features can be used without connecting to the Internet.

# Set-up #
In order to be able to use this feature, you will need [a Google user account](https://www.google.com/accounts).

Then you will need to visit the [CurrentCost Profiles site](http://currentcost.appspot.com/profile) to create yourself an account, and add yourself to the system.

Finally, you need to visit [the groups list](http://currentcost.appspot.com/groups/list) to choose which of the groups is appropriate to you. You can join as many groups as you like, and if you can't see a group that is suitable, create a new one!

You can come back to the groups page at any time to change your memberships.

# Using the feature #

<h1>Changing your mind</h1>

This feature is currently under a big redesign. There is lots of stuff left to write. One of the things not yet in place is a way for users to cancel their account and delete their data.<br>
<br>
I can do this manually though, so in the meantime, if you decide to cancel your account, and want your data removed from the system, please email dale.lane@gmail.com and I will do this for you.
