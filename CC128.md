# Intro #
In Feb 2009, CurrentCost brought out a new version of their monitor - the 'ENVI', also known as the 'CC128'. <sup>{1}</sup>

My CurrentCost GUI does work with the CC128, however the support is a little quirky. This page describes how it works now and why.

# Background #
The previous version of the CurrentCost monitor outputs a full copy of it's records of historical electricity usage every six seconds. I wrote my CurrentCost software to take advantage of this - it spends most of the time relying on the CurrentCost meter to store history, and whenever the user wants, they can request that the application connect to the meter to get the latest history data<sup>{2}</sup>. At most this would take 12 seconds or so, and then the application disconnects.

(The main benefit of this is that you can still get all the graphs, without needing to leave your PC switched on all the time<sup>{3}</sup>.)

The CC128 works differently. It **doesn't** output full history every six seconds - it only outputs it at 1 minute past every odd hour. (e.g. 1.01, 3.01, 5.01, etc.).

And it doesn't output the whole history in one message - it splits it up into several<sup>{4}</sup> messages, each bit output every six seconds. You need to wait for all of the messages to get the full history.

# How the software works now #
## Stay connected ##
'Download history' --> 'Stay connected' was added to make life easier with the CC128.

If you have a CC128 meter, you can click on 'Download history' --> 'Stay connected' **and then** either:

a) Leave it running until at least 1 minute past an odd numbered hour; or

b) Force the meter to start producing history data by pressing and holding the 'Down' and 'OK' buttons.<sup>{5}</sup>

History data will be received and stored in the background. When a block of new history data is received, graphs will be updated with the new data.

As long as the application is running and connected at 1 minute past the hour, then it will receive updated data - without you needing to time your connection<sup>{2}</sup> just right! And if you miss one history window, it doesn't matter - the meter stores the data for ages, so you can always let the software catch the next one.

## Download once ##
Alternatively, you can still use 'Download history' --> 'Download once'

Just click on that to make the connection first, and you should see the dialog box with an increasing number of updates received with only live (no history) data. Then, either:

a) Leave it running until at least 1 minute past an odd numbered hour; or

b) Force the meter to start producing history data by pressing and holding the 'Down' and 'OK' buttons.<sup>{5}</sup>


# Notes #
{1} - For more background about the meter, you can read about it on [CurrentCost.com](http://currentcost.com/product-cc128.html) or on [my blog](http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=389).

{2} - By clicking on: Download data -> Download history data... (connect directly)

{3} - You could switch on your PC once a month, connect to the meter for a few seconds, and still get full graphs of daily and monthly electricity usage.

{4} - As the amount of history stored increases, this can potentially be hundreds of messages.

{5} - Note that there is a problem with this approach - the meter's system clock will stop for the time it takes to transmit all of the history data messages. As this can potentially be several minutes (on a meter which has accumulated a large history set), this will result in your meter's clock being several minutes slow once complete. If you use this approach, you need to correct the clock time once you have finished.

{6} - For several minutes - a long time to watch a progress bar!
