## CurrentCost GUI ##
CurrentCost (http://www.currentcost.com) monitors allow you to monitor your home electricity usage. You can connect a serial cable to them to get the data out of them in an XML format.

This project contains an application written to capture this data and display it in the form of graphs and descriptions.

**See the [features page](Features.md) for a list of what the application can do and a few small screenshots.**

**UPDATE:** The software does work with the newer [CC128](CC128.md) meters.

Note:
> If you want to access the data from CurrentCost meters for use in your own applications, you may prefer to use source from http://code.google.com/p/currentcost/ which gives you enough source to parse and store CurrentCost data, without the graphical representations in this project.
